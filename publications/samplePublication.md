This question has haunted me since so long. My point is; we can’t change what is going to happen, (Can we?) then why to be afraid of mere predictions that we suppose may happen. This fear has been instilled in a child’s brain since (umm.. any gender) is born. Has our purpose of life been predestined or predetermined? Can’t the phases of life be flexible enough for us to let us think (at-least) for the change?

The day a child is born, parents start worrying and doing all sorts of things so that their child will get and be the best. They sacrifice everything and then cry before the child(in near future) that they have sacrificed for them, and in return also they need that their child will sacrifice his/her wishes,needs and wants for them(Don’t you think it is meaningless?).

12 fucking years, meaningless race, which really doesn’t matter at the end. Rotting things and vomiting them in exams (which also don’t matter) is what a child is taught to. For my parents, a child should be an all-rounder. I,being an ICSE student for 12 years am interested in sketching,singing and playing drums. Now,I mostly sketch during classes (PS: The T.O.C notebook submitted is almost full of Naruto (especially Sasuke xoxo), Pikachu, Tokyo Ghoul and Death note sketches), don’t sing and don’t play drums. The most amusing thing about dividing school time into periods which I still don’t understand is how can we switch from one period to another like in 35 mins. I mean if a person is solving a Maths problem and is really thinking and trying to solve it, and bell rings and English period starts, how the fuck he/she is supposed to switch his/her mind away from that interesting Maths problem and listen to his/her English teacher. Amidst all these then comes parental pressure which weighted more as I hadn’t friends to share and stayed at home most of time to continuously hear nagging. I understand they have been paralyzed by Indian society. After my JEE marks, they have stopped believing in me which is most hurting. So,basically now there is no-one except me who believes in me.

Children who can’t cope up with these pressures of society or pressure due to failures become thieves, rapists,etc. Does this mean our society harness conducive atmosphere where thieves,rapists can dwell? One question, we are told to give respect to pakoda-walas and auto-rickshaw-walas, but why don’t we are raised to become one? They can be beggars or rapists or thieves but being a pakoda-wala is a dishonor? We complain about Indian politics now and then, but are we raised to become politicians?

I understood this since I was in 6th standard and have been questioning and searching for answers since then. But after knowing and understanding the facts, I can’t change them. I always have been an introvert,I have no friends in school. I didn’t like to socialize. Well, I don’t know how I made some really good friends in college. Maybe Amrita Sundaray believes in me.

During April,this year My father called me and asked me to apply for the internship in Rourkela Steel Plant. I told him I don’t want to apply to some internship which won’t benefit me or for-the-sake-of-applying only. I told him I am trying for SymPy and yellowbrick(GSoC) and Haiku and Jupyterhub(Outreachy) and have been contributing and find it interesting and enjoyable. He said that everyone has already applied, Why the fuck I am always ignorant and adamant and don’t follow the herd or his instructions(they are never suggestions). He asked me to be more responsible about my future. To which I said I already am and don’t want to get an internship on credentials of my father(He works in RSP). To which he said I won’t be getting into GSoC or Outreachy. He says he knows my standard and asked me to stop dreaming big things and start following the herd aimlessly and meaninglessly. I didn’t get selected in GSoC because more than half the no. of mentors who had agreed to be mentoring backed out at the end. SymPy being such a huge and established org has only 4 to 5 mentors (including two maintainers) now for GSoC. Although the maintainer is really nice, and wrote an apology email for the short of mentors. Haiku had only one slot for Outreachy and Preetpal Kaur being the best got selected. I am really happy for her and am learning from her. From tomorrow my industrial training will start and I am forced to be there with an emotionless heart and face. I couldn’t change, but I won’t give up. I am contributing to many orgs and its the only solace for me.

So,back to the topic, why should we be afraid when we can’t change or don’t know what is going to happen? Should we go by the flow? Should we not think of change?Should we not try what we want to be? Should we allow others to impose their ideas on us? Should we give up? NO,NEVER EVER THINK OF THAT EVEN. Consider failures as steps and build your ladder to success using them. The more the no. of failures the higher the ladder. So, try and fail to succeed has always been my motto.

Thanks for reading. Basically it is a rant.
