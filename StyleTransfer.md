I developed a model that can create new images by mixing abstractions and outlines of one image and colour and styling of another image with better optimization
techniques using Python, Pytorch framework, which achieved an accuracy of 85%.

In this project I gained experience with style transfer, PyTorch, torchvision and associated technologies.
