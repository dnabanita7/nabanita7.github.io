**Grades seem important until you realise you can build something with what you’ve learned.** 

I was always inquisitive about learning new technology and building it. All I knew back then was get hired by some industry, contribute to their work after graduation. I came to know about open-source in my first year of Bachelors's. Since then I have never stopped learning or contributing to OSS (Open Source Software).
So, what is open source?

Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance because its design is publicly accessible.
Why open source?

First of all, as it accessible by everyone and maintained by everyone, anyone can contribute small or big. Anyone can view, copy, learn, alter or share the source code legally. This fetches in a vast range of ideas and contributions from diverse backgrounds.

Second point is open-source doesn’t discriminate on the basis of grades or gender or race. It has no selection criteria to judge you and then allow you to alter or play with the source code. Anybody who wants to learn or contribute to the open source projects are welcome.

Third is you can connect with and get to know and share knowledge from developers all over the world. You can know about their experiences and learning easily while sitting in the comfort of your home.
My journey into open source

I have been contributing to various open source organizations since my 3rd semester. My first contribution was to JupyterHub. It was intimidating at first. I couldn’t understand what was the issue at first. I spent days on it looking into documentation, other google links that popped up. I understood what was the issue after 5 days. Then I started searching for possible solutions on google. I never tested it on my local machine as I didn’t know how to do that yet. I started drafting a PR for the same. It got a few comments on it. It took me another 3 days to understand the comments. Then, I started working on those comments. The PR was never merged because it had some dependencies with other issues. Then I contributed to Coala and was made a member of newbies Coala. After that, I continued contributing to Gensim, yellowbrick, Haiku, SymPy, iterative/dvc, JuliaLang, Flux.jl, FluxModels.jl, JuliaReinforcementLearning.jl
My Contributions to open source software/projects

    ResNet model in Flux
    GoogLeNet model in Flux
    Addition of Adaptive Pooling layers in Flux which was featured at JuliaCon’20
    Changed labels to y vector, passed labels as list in yellowbrick
    Update bash auto-completion script
    The previous code only showed the file names, it didn’t autocomplete the commands
    Changed mpf(0) to None in S.Zero

The benefits of contributing to open source

Contributing to open source opens a path to contribute to new, emerging and developing technologies. Any small contribution starting from starring the project, playing around to check if everything works fine, fixing documentation, fixing a small bug, writing, testing, debugging, deploying software, or sponsoring the project is valuable and does matter.

Not only this helps the developer but the maintainer as well. I believe in learning by coding. So, contributing to open source teaches you how to write clean code efficiently. The small tweaks or quirks which the maintainer
will bring in the PR comments will teach you how to avoid simple silly mistakes and write idiomatic code in any language. Being able to contribute to any open source software no matter what your situation is or who you are
is another benefit of open source. Open source contributions are never discriminated on basis of gender or race.

Open source software is free and open to use and explore. Contributing to a particular organisation and being a member adds value to your GitHub profile. Most companies who hire on the basis of expertise might hire you
because of the many green dots on your GitHub profile. Apart from that meeting, chatting, developing with distinguished developers from around the world will be an amazing experience. Don’t forget the amazing friends you
will make on the chat workspace of the organisation. Perks such as going to conferences, getting swags, etc. should be counted in too.

Apart from these, there are many open source programs/fellowships meant for creating interest in students to develop OSS. Most of them are listed @open-source-programs. Getting a stipend and working on developing a project for the open source organisation in summer is self-rewarding and adds up on your resume.

I am writing vision and Reinforcement learning models which will be used as a benchmark in Julia. You can check out my GitHub page @dnabanita7.
